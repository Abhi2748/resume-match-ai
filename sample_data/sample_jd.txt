Requirements:-
2+ years of experience as a full-stack engineer or in a similar role.
Proficiency in front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
Strong back-end experience in Python, including designing and building scalable APIs and server-side logic.
Comfortable working with both SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases.
Skilled in RESTful API design and WebSocket integrations.
Experience with Git and collaborative workflows in modern software development environments.
Familiarity with cloud platforms (especially AWS) and containerization tools such as Docker for deployment and environment management.
Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Hands-on experience building with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) in ways that go well beyond basic prompting.
Practical knowledge of advanced LLM use cases including: Tool/function calling, Agentic workflows, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Finetuning models.
Familiarity with leading GenAI frameworks and tools such as LangChain, Hugging Face, LlamaIndex, Haystack, or similar.
Demonstrated ability to integrate AI capabilities into full-stack applications as part of side projects, prior work experience, or academic research.
A strong interest in the evolving AI/LLM landscape and a drive to stay ahead of emerging trends.
Responsibilities:-
Design, develop, and maintain both front-end and back-end components of GenAI-powered applications.
Build and integrate APIs and third-party services—including tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and various LLM platforms—to enhance AI functionality.
Collaborate closely with product and engineering teams to prototype and iterate on innovative, AI-driven user experiences.
Design and manage databases with a focus on performance, reliability, and scalability for AI-intensive applications.
Contribute to architecture discussions, especially around LLM integration, prompt pipelines, and agentic workflows.
